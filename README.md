WorkOS Hack Week project where I've built example navigation using Radix components: [https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/navigation-menu). The goal of this project was to show an example how different Radix components can be used together.
